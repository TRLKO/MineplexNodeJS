# Mineplex Node.js
I would just like to say this is definitely not the best code in the world

## Depends
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* MySQL database

## Running
* Edit the [config.yml](config.json) to match your database settings (Note: don't include your db's port on the host)
* Make sure your database is running
* Open up cmd prompt/terminal in the folder of the clone of this project
* Run ```npm install```
* After that is done installing the libraries run ```npm run production```
* You're all set!
